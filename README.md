# Virtual_Mouse

I'm excited to share that I've successfully completed the project of building my very own Virtual Mouse! This project promotes an approach for the human computer interaction (HCL) where we use real time camera for controlling the mouse function. Our proposed project is on hand gesture-based system that allows users to control desktop mouse movements using hand gesture. To detect hand gesture movements, our system makes use of a desktop webcam. The goal is to control mouse cursor functions with a simple camera or webcam rather than a traditional or standard devices. Using only a camera, the Virtual Mouse provides an infrastructure between the user and the machine. It enables the user to interact with a machine without the need for any mechanical or physical devices, and even allows to control mouse functions. The domain of the project is AI/ML. The programming language we used in this project is python. This ai virtual mouse project is based on the concept of computer vision.
